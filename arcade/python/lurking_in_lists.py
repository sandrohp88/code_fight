# Given two lists lst1 and lst2, your task is to return a list formed by the elements 
# of lst1 followed by the elements of lst2.

# Note: this is a bugfix task, which means that the function is 
# already implemented but there is a bug in one of its lines. Your task is to find and fix it.

# Example

# For lst1 = [2, 2, 1] and lst2 = [10, 11], the output should be
# listsConcatenation(lst1, lst2) = [2, 2, 1, 10, 11].

def listsConcatenation(lst1, lst2):
    res = lst1
    res.extend(lst2)
    return res

# There are some students standing in a row, each has some number written on their back. 
# The students are about to divide into two teams by counting off by twos: 
# those standing at the even positions (0-based) will go to team A, and those standing at 
# the odd position will join the team B.

# Your task is to calculate the difference between the sums of numbers written on the backs 
# of the students that will join team A, and those written on the backs of the students that will join team B.

# Example

# For students = [1, 11, 13, 6, 14], the output should be
# twoTeams(students) = 11.

# Students with numbers 1, 13 and 14 will join team A, and students with numbers 11 and 6 will join team B. 
# Thus, the answer is (1 + 13 + 14) - (11 + 6) = 11.

def twoTeams(students):
    return sum(students[::2]) - sum(students[1::2])

# Today is a good day: it's the kth year since you started to work at the company, 
# which means you have to have a party today. In order to get home earlier and prepare 
# for the jamboree, you need to get home early. You decided to remove each kth tasks 
# from your toDo list, since today is your day and you can do whatever you please.

# Given the list of task ids in your toDo list, remove each kth task from it and 
# return the list of remaining tasks.

# Example

# For k = 3 and toDo = [1237, 2847, 27485, 2947, 1, 247, 374827, 22],
# the output should be
# removeTasks(k, toDo) = [1237, 2847, 2947, 1, 374827, 22].
def removeTasks(k, toDo):
    del toDo[k-1::k]
    return toDo

# You were supposed to prepare a presentation about lists in Python, 
# but totally forgot about it. Now that you don't have enough time for it, 
# you decide to show some usage examples instead and say with the poker 
# face that this is how you understood the assignment.

# Now you need to implement a function that will display a list in the console. 
# Implement a function that, given a list lst, will return it as a string as follows: 
# "This is your list: lst".

# Example

# For lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be
# printList(lst) = "This is your list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]".

def printList(lst):
    return "This is your list: " + str(lst)

def main():
    # lst1 = [2, 2, 1]
    # lst2 = [10, 11]
    # print(listsConcatenation(lst1,lst2))
    # students = [1, 11, 13, 6, 14]
    # print(twoTeams(students))
    # toDo = [1237, 2847, 27485, 2947, 1, 247, 374827, 22]
    # print(removeTasks(3,toDo))
    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(printList(lst))
