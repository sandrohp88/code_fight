# One of your friends has an awful writing style: he almost never starts a message with a capital letter, but adds uppercase letters in random places throughout the message. It makes chatting with him very difficult for you, so you decided to write a plugin that will change each message received from your friend into a more readable form.

# Implement a function that will change the very first symbol of the given message to uppercase, and make all the other letters lowercase.

# Example

# For message = "you'll NEVER believe what that 'FrIeNd' of mine did!!1",
# the output should be
# fixMessage(message) = "You'll never believe what that 'friend' of mine did!!1".

def fixMessage(message):
    return message.capitalize()

# You've been working on a particularly difficult algorithm all day, and finally decided to take a break and drink some coffee. To your horror, when you returned you found out that your cat decided to take a walk on the keyboard in your absence, and pressed a key or two. Your computer doesn't react to letters being pressed when an unauthorized action appears, but allows typing whitespace characters and moving the arrow keys, so now your masterpiece contains way too many whitespace characters.

# To repair the damage, you need to start with implementing a function that will replace all multiple space characters in the given line of your code with single ones. In addition, all leading and trailing whitespaces should be removed.

# Example

# For line = "def      m   e  gaDifficu     ltFun        ction(x):",
# the output should be
# catWalk(line) = "def m e gaDifficu ltFun ction(x):".

def catWalk(code):
    return ' '.join(code.split())

# You found an awesome customizable Python IDE that has almost everything you'd like to see in your working environment. However, after a couple days of coding you discover that there is one important feature that this IDE lacks: it cannot convert tabs to spaces. Luckily, the IDE is easily customizable, so you decide to write a plugin that would convert all tabs in the code into the given number of whitespace characters.

# Implement a function that, given a piece of code and a positive integer x will turn each tabulation character in code into x whitespace characters.

# Example

# For code = "\treturn False" and x = 4, the output should be
# convertTabs(code, x) = "    return False".

def convertTabs(code, x):
    return code.replace("\t",x*' ')

# Unfortunately it looks like the feedbacks page is far from perfect: 
# each feedback is displayed as a one-line string, and if it's too 
# long there's no way to see what it is about. Naturally, this 
# horrible bug should be fixed. Implement a function that, given 
# a feedback and the size of the screen, splits the feedback into lines so that:

# each token (i.e. sequence of non-whitespace characters) belongs to one of the lines entirely;
# each line is at most size characters long;
# no line has trailing or leading spaces;
# each line should have the maximum possible length, assuming that 
# all lines before it were also the longest possible.
# Example

# For feedback = "This is an example feedback", and size = 8,
# the output should be

# feedbackReview(feedback, size) = ["This is", 
#                                   "an", 
#                                   "example", 
#                                   "feedback"]

# Given a word, check whether it is a palindrome or not. A string is considered to be a palindrome if it reads the same in both directions.

# Example

# For word = "aibohphobia", the output should be
# isWordPalindrome(word) = true;

# For word = "hehehehehe", the output should be
# isWordPalindrome(word) = false.

def isWordPalindrome(word):

# You found your very first laptop in the attic, and decided 
# to give in to nostalgia and turn it on. The laptop turned 
# out to be password protected, but you know how to crack it: 
# you have always used the same password, but encrypt it using 
# permutation ciphers with various keys. The key to the cipher 
# used to protect your old laptop very conveniently happened to be written on the laptop lid.

# Here's how permutation cipher works: the key to it consists of 
# all the letters of the alphabet written up in some order. 
# All occurrences of letter 'a' in the encrypted text are 
# substituted with the first letter of the key, all occurrences 
# of letter 'b' are replaced with the second letter from the key, 
# and so on, up to letter 'z' replaced with the last symbol of the key.

# Given the password you always use, your task is to encrypt 
# it using the permutation cipher with the given key.

# Example

# For password = "iamthebest" and
# key = "zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy", the output should be
# permutationCipher(password, key) = "hzlsgdadrs".

# Here's a table that can be used to encrypt the text:

# abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
# ||  |  ||   |     || 
# vv  v  vv   v     vv
# zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy

def permutationCipher(password, key):
    table = str.maketrans(string.ascii_lowercase,key)

# The World Wide Competitive Eating tournament is going to be held in your town, 
# and you're the one who is responsible for keeping track of time. For the great 
# finale, a large billboard of the given width will be installed on the main square,
# where the time of possibly new world record will be shown.

# The track of time will be kept by a float number. 
# It will be displayed on the board with the set precision 
# precision with center alignment, and it is guaranteed 
# that it will fit in the screen. Your task is to test the billboard. 
# Given the time t, the width of the screen and the precision 
# with which the time should be displayed, return a string that 
# should be shown on the billboard.

# Example

# For t = 3.1415, width = 10 and precision = 2,
# the output should be
# competitiveEating(t, width, precision) = "   3.14   ".

def competitiveEating(t, width, precision):

# You came to work in a big company as a Senior Python Developer. 
# Unfortunately your team members seem to be quite old-school: 
# you can see old-style string formatting everywhere in the code, 
# which is not too cool. You tried to force the team members to 
# start using the new style formatting, but it looks like it will 
# take some time to persuade them: old habits die hard, especially in old-school programmers.

# To show your colleagues that the new style formatting is not that 
# different from the old style, you decided to implement a function 
# that will turn the old-style syntax into a new one. Implement a 
# function that will turn the old-style string formating s into a 
# new one so that the following two strings have the same meaning:

# s % (*args)
# s.format(*args)
# Example

# For s = "We expect the %f%% growth this week", the output should be
# newStyleFormatting(s) = "We expect the {}% growth this week".

def newStyleFormatting(s):
    s = s.replace('%%', '__',len(s))

# Given such commit, your task is go remove the username part from it 
# and return the second part as an answer.

# Example

# For commit = "0??+0+!!someCommIdhsSt", the output should be
