    You've launched your brand new web application not long ago, and while in beta it got beta satisfied visitors. Encouraged by such success, you decided to go ahead and push the very first stable version live.
    You know that each beta visitor spent at least k minutes on your app, so now you'd like to keep track of new visitors of your web application that spent at least k minutes on it. Given the amount of time the visitors used your application and the value of k, return the total number of users that used your app for at least k minutes including those from beta.
    Example
    For beta = 22, k = 5, and visitors = [4, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 5],
    the output should be
    countVisitors(beta, k, visitors) = 26.
    4 new visitors spent at least 5 minutes on your application, which summed up with 22 satisfied beta users gives 26.

    Although Python does provide a bunch of useful built-in functions, some of them are simply missing for no apparent reason. One example of such function is a sign function implemented in many other languages. sign(x) returns 1 if x is positive, -1 if x is negative, and 0 if x is equal to zero.
    You decided to build your own package of useful functions, and would like to start with the sign function. Given the value of x, return the result of applying the sign function to it.
    Example
    For x = -34, the output should be
    sign(x) = -1.
    -34 is a negative number, thus the output should be -1.

    Tomorrow is Jim's first day as a teacher in a primary school. He's quite nervous about his new job, and in order to relax he decides to write a simple program, because nothing calms as much as coding.
    Since Jim is going to tell the kids about rectangles, he wants to implement a function that will calculate the area of rectangle of the given height and width and show how the result is obtained. Help Jim to gain his confidence and implement the function he needs.
    Example
    For height = 7 and width = 4, the output should be
    primarySchool(height, width) = "7 x 4 = 28".
    The area of the rectangle of size 7 Ã— 4 is calculated as 7 * 4 and is equal to 28.

    At CodeSignal information about the users is stored in the database. Anny is working on the class representation of this information, and needs to come up with a class that creates objects with the following attributes: username, _id, xp and name. She has already come up with a test object:
    username: "annymaster"

    name: "anny"
    The problem is, she doesn't know if this will be enough. It is possible that the server will require information about additional attributes that are not yet present in Anny's representation.
    Given the attribute the server requested, return its value if it is defined, and the <attribute> attribute is not defined string otherwise.
