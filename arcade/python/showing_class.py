    You've launched your brand new web application not long ago, and while in beta it got beta satisfied visitors. Encouraged by such success, you decided to go ahead and push the very first stable version live.
    You know that each beta visitor spent at least k minutes on your app, so now you'd like to keep track of new visitors of your web application that spent at least k minutes on it. Given the amount of time the visitors used your application and the value of k, return the total number of users that used your app for at least k minutes including those from beta.

    countVisitors(beta, k, visitors) = 26.

    Although Python does provide a bunch of useful built-in functions, some of them are simply missing for no apparent reason. One example of such function is a sign function implemented in many other languages. sign(x) returns 1 if x is positive, -1 if x is negative, and 0 if x is equal to zero.

    After years of practicing psychology you decided that it's time to find the answer to the following very important question: how can different species live together in harmony? In order to answer this question, you headed out for a long journey. After several years of wandering, you finally found what you were looking for: a village where humans, cats and dogs lived in the perfect harmony.
    Trying to understand the source of this harmony, you are gathering information about all members of the village community. You're currently working on determining the age of each member converted to human age. Here's how cats and dogs age can be converted:
    The first and the second years of a cat's life are roughly equal to 12.5 years of a human's, and after this, each additional year is around four 'human years'.
    The first year of a dog's life is equal to 15 years of a human's life, the second dog's year is equal to another 9 years of a human's life, and after this, each additional year is around four 'human years'.
    Given information about the members of the village community, return information about their ages converted to human age.
