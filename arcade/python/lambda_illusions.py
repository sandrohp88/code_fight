# To make debug output more understandable, you often separate sets of logs by a single line of 
# the same character. Since you use this method very often, you'd like to write a function that 
# would handle printing the separator.

# Implement a function that, given a character ch and the number of times it should be repeated n, 
# returns a string of n characters ch.

# Example

# For ch = '*' and n = 20, the output should be
# repeatChar(ch, n) = "********************".
# Answer:
# repeatChar = lambda c,n : str(c)*n
# A new scoring system was introduced in your university: from now on, each test will 
# consist of the predefined list of questions, and for the ith (1-based) question 
# a student either gets i points, or loses p points as a penalty.

# Your task is to calculate the number of points a student got for some test. 
# Implement a function that would calculate the number of points received for 
# the test based on the given list of answers.

# Example

# For answers = [true, true, false, true]and p = 2, the output should be
# getPoints(answers, p) = 5.

# Here's why: 1 + 2 - 2 + 4 = 5.

def getPoints(answers, p):
    questionPoints = lambda i,ans:   i+1 if ans else -p

    res = 0
    for i, ans in enumerate(answers):
        res += questionPoints(i, ans)
    return res

# You are given a list of students who want to apply to the internship at CodeFights. 
# For the ith student you know their full name students[i], which can consist of up 
# to 5 words (where a word is a set of consecutive letters). 
# It is guaranteed that the surname is always the last name of student's full name.

# Your task is to sort the students lexicographically by their surnames. 
# If two students happen to have the same surname, their order in the result 
# should be the same as in the original list.

# Example

# For

# students = ["John Smith", "Jacky Mon Simonoff", 
#             "Lucy Smith", "Angela Zimonova"]
# the output should be

# sortStudents(students) = ["Jacky Mon Simonoff", "John Smith", 
#                           "Lucy Smith", "Angela Zimonova"]
def sortStudents(students):
    students.sort(key=lambda x: x.split()[-1])
    return students

# You've been preparing all night for the upcoming test and entered the class 
# certain that you will ace it. Now that you received the test questions, 
# you died inside a little: looks like you prepared for the test on a completely different topic.

# You're not even sure if you should bother to answer the questions. 
# You still have some hope though: it is known that there's a glitch 
# in the test preparing system, so that if the sum of digits of question 
# ids is divisible by k, the answer to each question has a 90% probability to be an A.

# Given the list of question ids, determine if the sum of their digits is 
# divisible by k to see if it's worth trying to pass the test.

# Example

# For ids = [529665, 909767, 644200] and k = 3, the output should be
# isTestSolvable(ids, k) = true.

# The sum of digits is

# (5 + 2 + 9 + 6 + 6 + 5) + (9 + 0 + 9 + 7 + 6 + 7) + (6 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 0) = 87

def isTestSolvable(ids, k):
    digitSum = lambda id_sum :  sum(int(digit) for digit in str(id_sum)) 

    sm = 0
    for questionId in ids:
        sm += digitSum(questionId)
    return sm % k == 0
